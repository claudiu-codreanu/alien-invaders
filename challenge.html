        <h1>Challenge</h1>

        <div class="credit">Proposed by Marian Veteanu</div>

        <p>
            We are changing the pace of our coding challenges a little bit by entering the realm of video games. And as
            you can probably hint, this new challenge is all about creating a video game.
            Now is a good time to join kids and also act on this advice from president <a
                href="https://www.gamesbrief.com/2013/12/dont-just-buy-a-new-video-game-make-one-says-obama/"
                target="_blank">Obama</a>: <cite>"Don't just buy a new video game, make one!"</cite>
        </p>

        <p>
            In this coding challenge you take the role of a young bedroom coder that strives to implement a clone of
            (perhaps) the most influential game of all time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders"
                target="_blank">"Space Invaders"</a>.
            You played this game thousand of times at the mall arcade, and now you want to build your special version
            that you can share with your friends via the big world wide web.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore you plan to write your game using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas!
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course you plan to write a simplified version of the game. In your game a fleet of unidentified vessels
            are moving on the screen left and right … then slowly go down one step before changing direction.
            You need to destroy these vessels before they land using plasma bullets (see below). If you destroy all the
            vessels – you win. If they land – you lose. In either case, the game restarts and gives the player a new
            try.
        </p>

        <h3>How to work with the canvas?</h3>

        <p>
            Don’t worry – it is not difficult as this challenge comes with "training wheels": in order to eliminate the
            intricacies of HTML5 canvas and therefore be able to focus only on the game, a tiny "pseudo-library" is
            provided to you as starting point.
        </p>

        <p>
            The library implements a rudimentary game loop, together with a few other helper functions. The library API
            is inspired by the Processing API and in particular <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To use the library you either (1) copy it’s entire body in your code before the code you plan to write, or
            (2) save it in a .js file and include it in your HTML page before the code you plan to write as this:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            &lt;canvas id="canvas" tabindex="1" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
            <br>
            <br>
            &lt;script src="easycanvas.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            <br>
            <br>
            &lt;script&gt;
            <br>
            <br>
            // Copy the library code here (if you don’t include the above script). Either way, works great!
            <br>
            // Then ... write your game code here, after the helper functions!!!
            <br>
            <br>
            &lt;/script&gt;
        </div>

        <p>
            <b>*** Note</b>: The code of easyCanvas is provided in the attached text file.
        </p>

        <h3>What's inside easyCanvas?</h3>

        <p>
            There is no better way to see what’s inside easyCanvas than to inspect the code yourself. At a glance, after
            instantiation, easyCanvas populates the global space (e.g. window object) with a few helper constants and
            functions. You only need to use these to build your game!
        </p>

        <p>
            Don’t even try to access the canvas directly… these functions are all you need for this game.
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            // Clear the canvas with the specified color<br>
            function background(color)<br>
            <br>
            // Specify that the next shape won't be filled<br>
            function noFill()<br>
            <br>
            // Specify that the next shaped should be filled with specified color<br>
            function fill(color)<br>
            <br>
            // Specify that the next shape should not have a stroke stroke<br>
            function noStroke()<br>
            <br>
            // Specify the stroke width for the next shape<br>
            function strokeWidth(n)<br>
            <br>
            // Specify the stroke color for the next shape<br>
            function stroke(color)<br>
            <br>
            // Draw a rectangle<br>
            function rect(x, y, width, height)<br>
            <br>
            // Specify the text size of the next drawn text<br>
            function textSize(n)<br>
            <br>
            // Write a text at specified coordinates<br>
            function text(txt, x, y)<br>
            <br>
            // Returns true if key with specified code is pressed<br>
            function keyIsDown(code)<br>
        </div>

        <h3>What about the game loop?</h3>

        <p>
            Did you pay attention to the statements above? For the implementation of your game you need to use the "game
            loop pattern".
        </p>

        <p>
            Robert Nystrom compares the game loop with the <cite>"best thing since slide bread"</cite>.
            He also explains <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html" target="_blank">what it
                is</a>: <cite>"A game loop runs continuously during gameplay. Each turn of the loop, it processes user
                input without blocking, updates the game state, and renders the game."</cite>
        </p>

        Sounds fancy? … don’t be discouraged. All you have to do is to write your logic inside the “loop” function and
        the easyCanvas “library” will call your function in a loop.

        <h3>More hints, please!</h3>

        <p>
            OK … one more hint and now you should be ready to start working on the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before you start working on the game, try to run and understand the following code.
            The code shows how to implement the main mechanics of your game:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            &lt;canvas id="canvas" tabindex="1" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br>
            <br>
            &lt;script src="easycanvas.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
            <br>
            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            <br>
            // Note: Include the code of easyCanvas here if you don't include the above script<br>
            <br>
            // ===============<br>
            // BEGIN USER CODE<br>
            // ===============<br>
            <br>
            var xObject = 0;<br>
            var xPaddle = width / 2;<br>
            <br>
            textSize(12);<br>
            <br>
            // This function gets called automatically in a `loop` by the `engine`<br>
            function loop() {<br>
            <div class="indent">
                // Clear the canvas<br>
                background("black");<br>
                <br>
                // Draw the moving object<br>
                noFill();<br>
                strokeWidth(2);<br>
                stroke("white");<br>
                rect(xObject, 10, 30, 30);<br>
                <br>
                // Draw the paddle<br>
                fill("red");<br>
                noStroke();<br>
                rect(xPaddle, height - 50, 100, 30);<br>
                <br>
                // Display text<br>
                fill("white");<br>
                text("Use LEFT and RIGHT arrows to move", 10, 580);<br>
                <br>
                // Update object position<br>
                xObject++;<br>
                <br>
                // Update paddle on key press<br>
                if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW)) {<br>
                <span class="indent">xPaddle += 3;</span><br>
                }<br>
                else if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)) {<br>
                <span class="indent">xPaddle -= 3;</span><br>
                }<br>
                else if (keyIsDown(SPACE)) {<br>
                <span class="indent">// place shooting code here...</span><br>
                }<br>
            </div>
            }<br>
            <br>
            &lt;/script&gt;
        </div>

        <h3>Bonus points</h3>
